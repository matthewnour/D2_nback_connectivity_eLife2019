# D2_nback_connectivity_eLife2019
Data and code for the paper: 'Task-induced functional brain connectivity mediates the relationship between striatal D2/3 receptors and working memory', published in eLife 2019

eLife_code contains the MATALB and R scripts needed to reproduce the main funcitonal connectivity results from the above paper. 
The scripts call upon the data in the eLife_data folder. Supplementary scriptsare included to illustrate how key variables were created (e.g. consensus clustering and calculation of load-dependent connectivity change)

This data is in the form of
 - single-subject WM-load-specific functional connectitivity matrices (following preprocessing of fMRI data as outlined in the paper)
 - single-subject n-back performance measures (using the proportional-pRT measure outlined in the paper)
 - single-subject regional D2/3R availability measures for bilateral caudate, accumbens, whole striatum and SN/VTA 
 - participant demographics
  
Further data is available from the lead author upon reasonable request and participant consent.
